# steganography
This is a project, devoted to implementation of the methods of data concealing in vector images (algorithms are based on Kinseryaviy's works).
Please, use only images, which are provided in resources/svgImages directory (unless you do not mind getting nothing from application).
A project is created for research, image parser is not ideal and does not track all exceptions of vector images.
Used format of vector images is SVG.
Initial code may change within time.
Have fun!
